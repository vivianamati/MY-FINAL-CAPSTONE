    <p><u>PALM JUMEIRAH</u></p>
    <img src="the palm.jpg" alt="Palm Jumeirah">
    <p>The Palm Jumeirah is an archipelago of artificial islands on the Persian Gulf in Jumeirah, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
         It is part of a larger series of developments called the Palm Islands, including Palm Jebel Ali and Deira Islands, which, 
         when completed, will together increase Dubai's shoreline by a total of 520 kilometres (320 mi).
          It has a population of over 25,000 as of 2022.
          The islands were created using land reclamation. 
          The Palm Jumeriah construction was done by a Dutch specialist dredging company,
           Van Oord. The same company also created The World. 
           The recently opened destinations The Pointe, Club Vista Mare and Nakheel Mall are the
            latest additions to Palm Jumeirah.

    <p><u>DUBAI MALL</u></p>
    <img src="dubai mall.jpg" alt="Dubai Mall">
    <p>Dubai Mall (originally known as The Dubai Mall until 2023) (Arabic: دبي مول "Dubai Mall") is a shopping mall in Dubai. 
        It is the second-largest mall in the world by total land area and the 26th-largest shopping mall in the world by gross 
        leasable area, tying with West Edmonton Mall and Fashion Island (Bangkok)—both of which are older than it. It has a total 
        retail floor area of 8946,000 square metres (5,400,000 sq ft). Located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, it is part of the 
        20-billion-dollar Downtown complex (called Downtown Dubai) adjacent to the iconic Burj Khalifa, and includes over 1,200 
        shops. In 2011, it was the most visited building on the planet, attracting over 54 million visitors each year.
        Twice delayed, Dubai Mall opened on 4 November 2008, with about 1000 retailers, marking the world's second-largest 
        ever mall opening in retail history behind West Edmonton Mall. However, it does not have the most gross leasable space, 
        and is surpassed in that category by nineteen malls including the New South China Mall, which is the world's second-largest
        , Golden Resources Mall, SM City North Edsa, and SM Mall of Asia. In January 2023, the shopping mall announced that it is 
        officially changing its name from "The Dubai Mall" to "Dubai Mall." The minor name change eliminated one word from its title
         – "The."

    <p>Maasai Mara, also sometimes spelled Masai Mara and locally known simply as The Mara, is a large national game reserve in Narok, Kenya, contiguous with the

        Nile Basin. Their description of the area when looked at from afar: "Mara" means "spotted" in the local Maasai language, because of the short bushy trees 
        which dot the landscape.Maasai Mara is one of the wildlife conservation and wilderness areas in Africa, with its populations of lion, leopard, cheetah and
         African bush elephant. It also hosts the Great Migration, which secured it as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa, and as one of the ten Wonders of
