<b>DAY 1 & 2: ROME</b>
<p>The first day in Rome can be challenging if you arrive on a red-eye flight. Do your best to get adjusted to the time change, visit a 
    few sites in the afternoon, and consider going to bed a little early.With less than two full days in Rome, you will not be able to 
    see everything, but some of the must-see sites include the Colosseum, the Pantheon, the Borghese art gallery, and a tour of the Vatican.
     Stroll through Piazza Navona and consider having dinner in the Trastevere neighborhood.</p>
     <b>DAY 3, 4 & 5: FLORENCE AND TUSCANY</b>
     <p>Travel by train to Florence. This journey takes just 1.5 hours, so if you leave early in the morning you will have most of the day in
         Florence.Travel by train to Florence. This journey takes just 1.5 hours, so if you leave early in the morning you will have most of the 
         day in Florence.On this itinerary, you have three days in Florence and Tuscany. Florence needs at least one full day to see the main sites.
          You should also spend one full day in Tuscany. There are numerous hill towns to visit as well as Siena, one of our favorite spots in Italy. 
          You have to decide how to spend the third day: more time in gorgeous Florence or another day in Tuscany, visiting the small towns and vineyards.
          We recommend spending two days in Florence with one day for day tripping into Tuscany. Learn how to plan your time in Florence with our 2 Day 
          Florence Itinerary and get ideas on places to visit in Tuscany in our article Best Day Trips from Florence.
          One of the best ways to get around Tuscany is to hire a driver. This allows you to sit back and enjoy the views and the wine without the hassles
           of parking and navigating between the towns. If you are more independent, you can rent a car (this is what we did after our terrible experience 
           with the public bus system in Italy). We do not recommend the bus. On more than one occasion, the bus failed to show up, leaving us stranded 
           on the side of the road. This not only happened in Tuscany but also Sorrento and Amalfi.</p>
<h1><u><b>DAY 6 & 7: CINQUE TERRE</b></u></h1>
<p>On the morning of day 6, take the train from Florence to the Cinque Terre. It takes between 1.5 to 3 hours to get to the Cinque Terre. Direct trains take 
    less time but there are many more options that have a transfer in Pisa. You can take a few hours to visit Pisa on the way to the Cinque Terre, but you 
    would be missing out on some valuable time in the Cinque Terre.If you are booking a train to the Cinque Terre, you will arrive in La Spezia and then take
     the local train to one the five towns of the Cinque Terre. It takes just 9 minutes to travel from La Spezia to the first town, Riomaggiore, and trains run 
     very frequently.The Cinque Terre is magical. Five picture perfect towns perched along the Mediterranean coastline just waiting to be explored. You can spend 
     a full day hiking between them or use the train to hop between towns.</p>

                <h1><u><b>GREECE</b></u></h1>
                <b>Day 1: start in Athens, the nation’s cradle</b>
                <p>Don’t delay; climb the hill in the center of Athens to the magnificent Acropolis. Descending back into the land of mortals, wander the ancient Agora neighborhood before joining the merry mobs hopping from one taverna to another in the Plaka district. For extra credit, pause at some point at the extraordinary Acropolis Museum.
                
                Go from Athens to Mykonos: Catch one of the many ferries that make the run from Piraeus, the main port of Athens, to Mykonos. The fast times are on speedy hydrofoils, while the slower runs are on traditional boats, with their broad and sunny decks.</p>
                
                <b>Day 2: sail the Aegean to Mykonos</b>
                <p>Burn off your pre-trip stress on the island of Mykonos. One of Europe’s fabled party destinations (St Tropez and Ibiza are rivals), this small island has just enough to keep you occupied by day. Explore the maze of covered lanes, boutiques and flower-bedecked cafes in the old town of Hora. Head to nearby beaches for your first dip in the ever-blue Aegean. But save some energy for well after dark when the notorious clubs like to party until dawn – or later.</p>
                
                <b>Day 3: walk with the ancient Greeks in Delos</b>
                <p>Fight off any after-effects of the night before and catch a morning boat to Delos, the mythological birthplace of Apollo and Artemis. The entire island is a sacred shrine – ruins stretch across the sunbaked landscape. Let your imagination run wild as you reconstruct this once magnificent center in your mind. Make the quick return to Mykonos by boat and cool off at a beach. Then get lost in Hora until you stumble upon the perfect seafood dinner.
                
                </p>
                
                <b>Day 4: relax on Paros</b>
                <p>Something of a ferry hub for the Cyclades, Paros – the group of islands that in many ways defines Greece – literally has something for everyone. Flower-draped tavernas in the port town of Parikia make great post-ferry lunch spots.
                
                Get a rental car and drive the circumference of the island. This can be an all-day adventure and includes plenty of beach access along the east coast. The island is also noted for its produce – especially the tomatoes – so enjoy something delicious in the oh-so-cute mountain village of Lefkes or the locally popular beachside town of Aliki.</p>
                
                <b>Day 5: slow down on Antiparos</b>
                <p>Almost touching its much larger neighbor, the diminutive island of Antiparos really is the anti-Paros. Parts of the island qualify as sleepy, and there’s an unhurried vibe across its narrow, windy roads. Take the quick boat ride to Despotiko, a restored ancient sanctuary, then enjoy a seafood feast in Agios Georgios at a waterfront taverna. If you’re feeling sporty, join the windsurfers taking advantage of some of the most reliable winds in Greece.</p>
                
                <b>Day 6: join the throngs on Santorini</b>
                <p>With its polychromatic cliffs soaring above its drowned caldera, Santorini is the definition of a ‘Greek island’ for many. Steep and narrow lanes are lined with brilliantly whitewashed houses topped with cerulean domes. Beaches dot the curving coast, and gentle hiking paths follow the island’s spine, offering sweeping views. Sunsets are mesmerizing. Take in the spectacle from tiny hillside Oia, which offers a choice of tavernas serving deeply traditional Greek fare (expect grilled meats, creamy tzatziki and more).</p>
                
                <b>Day 7: get lost in Greece’s best palace at Knossos</b>
                <p>The island of Crete is so big that it almost feels like its own country. The main city of Iraklio is best enjoyed for a quick lunch in a café and as a place to secure a rental car. Then charge south for barely 20 minutes to one of the top ancient sites in a nation of ancient sites. The Palace of Knossos was built by the Minoans and is a vast and somewhat restored ruin that can easily absorb half a day or more. If you have time to take a tour, there are more than a dozen wineries nearby that make the excellent local wines you’ll enjoy with every meal.</p>
                
                <b>Day 8: revel in the stunning beauty of Crete</b>
                <p>Crete’s second city of Hania is really the island’s first city in the hearts of those in the know. The old town and harbor combine the legacies of the Minoans, the ancient Greeks, the Venetians and countless other influences from occupiers and others who just happened to sail by. The food here is extraordinary, and the chefs put Crete’s fabled produce to remarkable use. Two excellent detours are the absorbing ancient port town of Rethymno and the grand and glittery Orthodox churches in the hills, such as Moni Arkadiou.</p>

                    <b><u><h1>SWITZERLAND</h1></u></b>
                                        <b>Day 1 — Zurich City Tour</b>
                                        <p>This city is known for its vibrant nightlife, cosmopolitan atmosphere, and world-class museums. Located in the northeastern part of the country, it sits on the shores of its own lake, offering travelers beautiful scenery after they explore the city, which is a blend of modernity and tradition.

I assume you’ll be arriving in the city in the morning during your trip. So, we will begin the actual exploration of the city in the afternoon.

Depending on what you like to explore, there are plenty of options. You can try sightseeing in Bahnhofstrasse to see what the famous shopping district in Zurich all is about. Alternatively, you can walk along the city’s promenade beside the lake for scenery that should serve as an appetizer to the breathtaking views that await you in the Swiss Alps.

However, I would strongly suggest that you spend more time in the Old Town of Zurich visiting the city’s historical attractions or museums. Since you will be spending more time in nature in the coming days of your trip, it is reasonable to explore the city for a balanced and well-rounded Switzerland trip.

Don’t forget to see the iconic churches of Zurich like Fraumünster, which has stained glass designed by Marc Chagall. Visit the Swiss National Museum for an introduction to the history and culture of the country that you’ll be visiting! At sunset, head to Uetliberg where you can get a beautiful overlooking view of the city.

Known to have the best nightlife in Switzerland, you might not want to miss the nightlife in Zurich. I’m not much into nightlife so I can’t recommend. But if you want to try, Langstrasse, known for its diverse nightlife scene, can be a nice place to start. If you can’t party yet on your first day, don’t worry. You’ll be staying in Zurich until the night of Day 2.</p>

<b>Day 2 — Day Trip to Lucerne & Mount Pilatus</b>
<p>Don’t worry about the intercity travel, as getting to Lucerne from Zurich is a quick 45-minute single train ride. What’s better? Old Town Lucerne is literally a stone’s throw away from the train station. As soon as you arrive in the city, you can already start exploring the charming historic center of Lucerne if you want.

However, I suggest that you head straight to Mount Pilatus first after you arrive in the area. Mount Pilatus, considered by many as one of Switzerland’s most beautiful mountains, is a must-visit for the stunning views of Lake Lucerne, fun adventures, and unique experiences.

One of these unique experiences is the Pilatus Railway, which is the world’s steepest cogwheel train. If you are traveling with your family, the toboggan run on this mountain makes the visit even more exciting.

Why do I suggest visiting this place first during your second day in Switzerland? It’s simple: it’s more enjoyable when tourists aren’t crowding the mountains yet. During the morning, the experience in the mountains should feel more serene and queues to the different attractions in the mountains don’t exist yet.

Visiting Mount Pilatus could last for an entire day or half day, depending on you. Just don’t forget to have enough time to explore Old Town Lucerne after spending time in Mount Pilatus.

There are plenty of things to see in Old Town Lucerne and they are not just ordinary landmarks. One of them is Europe’s oldest wooden covered bridge, known as the Chapel Bridge. During the summer, the bridge looks so charming with the flowers decorating it.

Another must-see landmark in Lucerne is the Musegg Wall, which is the most preserved medieval wall in Switzerland. Aside from those, you should also see the churches of Lucerne like the Jesuit Church, which has stunning baroque interiors.

</p>

<b>Day 3 — Exploring the Old City of Bern</b>
<p>The second part of your fourteen-day Switzerland trip begins in the morning of your third day in the country.

During this time, you’ll be moving from Zurich to Bern, where you’ll begin uncovering the beautiful places within and nearby the Swiss capital city. Using the train, you should arrive in Bern approximately one hour after you leave Zurich.

After you’ve checked in/dropped your bags at your hotel in Bern and taken a rest, it’s time to begin touring the Old City of Bern, which I think is the most beautiful place in all of Switzerland when it comes to architecture.

Did you know that the Old City of Bern is a UNESCO World Heritage Site? True to its status as the capital of Switzerland, the old city of Bern is a symbol of the country’s wealth and rich heritage.

The arcades, the colorful fountains, and the imposing landmarks in the Old City of Bern are definitely the things that separate Bern from other destinations in Switzerland, making it a must-see for any trip to Switzerland, regardless of the length.

There are plenty of things to do in Bern, but the ones I really recommend you seeing are the Bern Cathedral, Zytglogge, Kramgasse, and Bundeshaus. You can finish leisurely exploring these places in Bern within half a day.

After that, proceed to the Rose Garden where you can take in an overlooking view of the Old City of Bern. The view is unmissable during sunset. If you want, you can eat your dinner at the romantic alfresco seating of the Rose Garden Restaurant. If the weather permits, the ambiance could be absolutely romantic.

After the Rose Garden, it is probably night already, which is the time for the Spooky Bern Tour. Join to discover the stories of the witches and wicked spirits behind the dark history and legends in Bern.</p>

<b>Day 4 — Interesting Discoveries in the Museums of Bern</b>
<p>On day three, it’s likely that you’ll stumble upon various viewpoints in Bern. Some of these offer a view of the Alps, such as the one behind the Bundeshaus. If you’re a mountain lover, I believe you’ll be excited to visit the beautiful destinations in the Swiss Alps. Weather permitting, you can even spot Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau from Bern!

However, before you go there, don’t miss the opportunity for fun and intriguing discoveries in Bern’s museums. In my opinion, there are a few museums in Bern worth seeing, especially if you’re interested in art, history, technology, and science. These are the museums you should check out on the fourth day of your Switzerland itinerary.</p>
<b>Day 5 — Day Trip to Thun</b>
<p>For the 5th day of your Switzerland trip, you’re going to take a day trip to Thun. This city, located 30 kilometers south of Bern, is often referred to as the gateway to the Bernese Oberland or Bernese Alps. You can reach this beautiful city with a mere 30-minute train ride from Bern. If you’d ask me, I’d describe Thun as a smaller version of Lucerne, yet offering more fairytale experiences.

Did you know that Thun has its own lake named after the city? To me, it’s the most magical lake in all of Switzerland. Not because it’s home to mystical creatures, but because it’s the lake with the most fairytale-looking castle.

Around Lake Thun, you can visit five castles. However, for this 14-day Switzerland trip, I suggest seeing only three of them: Schadau Castle, Thun Castle, and Oberhofen Castle.</p>

<b>Day 6 — Geneva City Tour</b>
<p>If you plan to leave Switzerland by evening, you still have the whole morning and early afternoon to explore Geneva. This time will be enough to see the notable and historical landmarks of the city.</p>
